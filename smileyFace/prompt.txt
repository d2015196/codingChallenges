Hi Diana,

Nice speaking with you today! Here is the challenge that Dave mentioned:

Write a Python program that:

- Takes the path to a PGM formatted image file on the command line (can assume 8-bit PGMs)
- Overlays a smiley face on the image
- Writes the image out to another PGM file

Please provide source code and a makefile. See if you can avoid using any special libraries to read and write the image files!

Thanks!
